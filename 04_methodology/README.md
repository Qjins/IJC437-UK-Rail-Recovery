Methodology Overview

This project follows a structured data science workflow:

1. Data collection from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR)
2. Data cleaning and aggregation at the regional level
3. Exploratory data analysis to identify temporal and spatial patterns
4. Construction of a recovery index using 2019 as the baseline
5. Calculation of the recovery gap to quantify uneven recovery

This structure mirrors the methodology described in Section 2 of the report.
